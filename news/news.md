# **Server Update, February 14, 2023**

New mobs in the wild! We added the `animalia` mod to the server, by the same
creator of `draconis`: ElCeejo.

Animalia brings a new set of wild life to the server, with very nice textures
and interesting mechanics. Explore the world to figure out what new creatures
you will discover!

We also have activated the new vehicle from the latest update: the Vespa
motorcycle!  Ride this motorcycle around the server and help us build some new
road blocks connecting all world areas.

This update also includes a new mod to help builders: `school_forniture`, by our
community member José Anastácio! This new mod will add several new forniture to
build our virtual class room, providing a more immersive experience.

A final change: wasps from `dmobs` will no longer spawn so we only need to deal
with the remaining ones that were already spawned. Wasp bosses will still spawn
so watch out for them!
