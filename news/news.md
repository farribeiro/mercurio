# **Server Updates February 2023**

![0,0,l](item:///animalia:crate)

New mobs in the wild! We added the `animalia` mod to the server, by the same
creator of `draconis`: ElCeejo. This was suggested by the Minetest forum user
`KingBull`, as a way to fix an issue while tamming Wyverns and possibly feeding
Draconis dragons.

Animalia brings a **new set of wild life to the server**, with beautiful 
textures and interesting mechanics. Explore the world to figure out what new
creatures you will discover!

![0,0,r](item:///automobiles_motorcycle:motorcycle)

We also have activated the new vehicles from the latest `automobiles_pck`
update: the Vespa motorcycle and Delorian car! Ride this motorcycle around the
server and help us build some new roads connecting all world areas.

This update also includes a new mod to help builders: `school_furniture`, by our
community member **José Anastácio**! This new mod will add several new furniture
to build our virtual class room, providing a more immersive experience. Also
added in this update, the mod pack `morelights` and `morelights_dim`, as well as
the `ethereal_stuff` will help you get new and interesting elements to your
regular builds.  Let's build amazing things around the world!

![0,0,r](item:///crystals:ghost_crystal_2)

Tired to see the same lands over and over? No more places do dig as you reached
the final Xtraores level? Fear not: you can now try to **explore the space!**.
We added the mod `other_worlds` to the server, to allow players to have new
exploration adventures! You will need to use the vehicles to travel up, managing
the fuel usage and potentially creating some Travelnet checkpoints along the
way: space starts at 5000 blocks in height. In space, you will start to discover
a new and interesting portion of the server filled with asteroids and unique
crystals.

We also attempted to change some behavior of existing mods to improve the
gameplay:

1. Wasps from `dmobs` will no longer spawn so we only need to deal with the remaining ones that were already spawned. Wasp bosses will still spawn so watch out for them!
2. Dragons from `dmobs` mod will no longer spawn. Take care of the ones you have tammed. If you have these dragon eggs, you can also still hatch them and get these ancient and unique creatures.
3. We also have an **updated inventory interface**. The goal fot this was to make the inventory interface easier to use on Android. Let us know what you think about it on Discord!
