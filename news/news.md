## Updates for Sep, 22

**New**: Added the mod `blockexchange`. This mod allows you to upload
your builds to the https://blockexchange.minetest.ch website. This portal will
help you preserve your builds once you finish them. This will help admins to
recover your build in case it was destroyed. This will also allow you to export
your hard work and restore it using the same mod or a schem file using World
Edit. This restoring process can help you load your build on another server or
for local gameplay.

For details about how to use this mod see this page:
https://github.com/blockexchange/blockexchange

**New**: Automobiles are now able to climb regular blocks. Due to poppular
demand, APercy added a new feature for the automobiles in which they can now
ride on irregular terrain as well as nicelly built roads. Try it out!
