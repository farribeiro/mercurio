# **Server Updates, September 2023**

The server was updated to the Minetest 5.7.0 engine version.
There are no significant changes in gameplay, but this new
version fixed some bugs and also brings performance improvements.

If you find any issues, mention @ronoaldo in chat so the server
hosting team can work on them.
