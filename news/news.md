# **Important**

Dear players: the server **Mercurio** will be cleaned up to save disk space.
We don't want your buildings to be lost, and only protected areas will be
exported, so it is very important to **protect your buildings**.

You can also use the mod `block_exchange` to upload your areas and download
them to play offline.
