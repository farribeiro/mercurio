# **Important**

Dear players: the server **Mercurio** will be shut down in Jan, 2024.
The server maintainer, `ronoaldo`, will stop the server hosting in January,
and starting from now it is not possible to create new accounts.

We don't want your buildings to be lost, so we will be making an export
of the server map so you can keep playing offline.
Only protected areas will be exported, so it is very important to
**protect your buildings**. You can also use the mod `block_exchange`
to upload your areas and download them to play offline.
