# Important Change

We are moving the server to a new virtual machine. A beta release of the newer infra
is available for testing. When it is up, it shows as **Mercurio | Open Beta Test Server**
on the official server list, and it has an old backup that was restored for testing.

Everyone is welcome to try the new version while it is hot and kindly report any issues
to Discord (link to discord at the end of this dialog).

*Thanks! -- Ronoaldo Pereira*

# **Server Update July 10, 2022**

Server was updated this week to add new mods and fixes! New items for those who
enjoy **climbing** and **sailing**, new **tools** for farmers and a new vehicle to
explore deep underseas.

## Climbing

![0,0,r](item:///hook:hook)

New **climbing** items for you to explore the high mountains that the mapgen creates.
You can use the **hook** and **ropes** to easily reach high parts without an airplane.
After you are high in the sky, you can jump with a **hang glider** and enjoy the view.

## More ways to explore the sea

![0,0,r](item:///nautilus:boat)

We already have a **motor boat**, and now with this update we have two new ways to
enjoy the sea. The **sailing kit** will make your sailing simulation a bit more fun,
including the mod **sailing cloth**.

Once you reach a place you want to explore deeper, use the newly added **nautilus**
submarine crafted with different materials for under sea exporation.

## Farming tools

![0,0,r](item:///moreores:hoe_silver)

Missing recipes for the farming hoes were added for Silver and Mithril hoes. You can
now craft these items from the inventory page and use them in your farms.

# **Server Update May 22, 2022**

![0,0,r](item:///default:pick_diamond)

Server was updated this week to pull in some important fixes. We updated server
engine to 5.5.1, which has important security fixes as well as several bug fixes
from 5.5.0 release.

We also have the regular mod updates, specifically:

```
* APercy Airplanes (airutils, demoiselle, supercub, trike)
* ElCeejo Draconis (creatura, draconis)
* Unified Inventory (by RealBadAngel, minetest-mods)
* TenPlus1 mods (bonemeal, ethereal, mobs, mobs_animal)
* VanessaE mods (homedecor_modpack, unifieddyes, signs_lib)
* Minenews (by Ronoaldo)
* Tubelib (by joe7575)
```

We were unable to update `Mesecons`. It caused a lot of dependency errors,
because of new way the modpack declares dependencies.
