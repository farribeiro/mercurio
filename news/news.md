# **Server Update August 15, 2022**

New update to mods up to August 15. This release updates basically the APercy
vehicles and airplanes which should bring some extra sanity checks to avoid
server crashes as well as the updated and reformulated Draconis mod.

In this update Draconis brings a new set of behavor changes, including the new
Libri, the way dragons attack players as well as other mobs, and the way we
build the draconis tools. The main focus is also with the artwork, so all
models and textures were remade with a new style.

Make sure to check if your dragons have any issues and report in our Discord
server linked bellow!

# **Server Update August 10, 2022**

Regular update to fetch newer versions of server mods, and fix server crashes
as well.

We noticed that first Trike and after that, PA28, started to cause server
crashes.  This is strange, as the mods has not been updated when it started to
crash, but we don't know the reason yet. APercy made updates to the mods in
order to protect the server from crashing while we investigate further.

Server was updated this week to add new mods and fixes! New items for those who
enjoy **climbing** and **sailing**, new **tools** for farmers and a new vehicle to
explore deep underseas.

![0,0,r](item:///hook:hook)

## Climbing

New **climbing** items for you to explore the high mountains that the mapgen creates.
You can use the **hook** and **ropes** to easily reach high parts without an airplane.
After you are high in the sky, you can jump with a **hang glider** and enjoy the view.

![0,0,r](item:///nautilus:boat)

## More ways to explore the sea

We already have a **motor boat**, and now with this update we have two new ways to
enjoy the sea. The **sailing kit** will make your sailing simulation a bit more fun,
including the mod **sailing cloth**.

Once you reach a place you want to explore deeper, use the newly added **nautilus**
submarine crafted with different materials for under sea exporation.

## Farming tools

Missing recipes for the farming hoes were added for Silver and Mithril hoes. You can

# **Server Update May 22, 2022**

![0,0,r](item:///default:pick_diamond)

Server was updated this week to pull in some important fixes. We updated server
engine to 5.5.1, which has important security fixes as well as several bug fixes
from 5.5.0 release.

We also have the regular mod updates, specifically:

```
* APercy Airplanes (airutils, demoiselle, supercub, trike)
* ElCeejo Draconis (creatura, draconis)
* Unified Inventory (by RealBadAngel, minetest-mods)
* TenPlus1 mods (bonemeal, ethereal, mobs, mobs_animal)
* VanessaE mods (homedecor_modpack, unifieddyes, signs_lib)
* Minenews (by Ronoaldo)
* Tubelib (by joe7575)
```

We were unable to update `Mesecons`. It caused a lot of dependency errors,
because of new way the modpack declares dependencies.
