# **Welcome to Mercurio Server!**

The server is designed to be friendly and enjoyable! Please:

```
* Do not destroy other player's properties.
* Do not appropriate other player's items.
* No dating allowed.
* No forms of discrimination are tolerated.
* Be family friendly and kids safe.
```

**Moderators reserve the right to ban players that do not _behave properly_**

.

---------------------

# **Important**

**Protect your buildings**. It is important to protect your areas
and buildings because the server will have a **massive map cleanup**.
This means that **`unprotected regions will be removed!`**.
This is necessary because the server map is over 80G of space.
Use items from the protector mod:
![0,0](item:///protector:protect)

Or use `/help` to learn how to use areas mod with the commands.
