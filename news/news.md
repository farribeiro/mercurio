# **Server Update March 25, 2022**

Server was updated this week to add new mods and fixes! New items for those who
enjoy **climbing** and **sailing**, new **tools** for farmers and a new vehicle to
explore deep underseas.

## Climbing

![0,0,r](item:///hook:hook)

New **climbing** items for you to explore the high mountains that the mapgen creates.
You can use the **hook** and **ropes** to easily reach high parts without an airplane.
After you are high in the sky, you can jump with a **hang glider** and enjoy the view.

## More ways to explore the sea

![0,0,r](item:///nautilus:boat)

We already have a **motor boat**, and now with this update we have two new ways to
enjoy the sea. The **sailing kit** will make your sailing simulation a bit more fun,
including the mod **sailing cloth**.

Once you reach a place you want to explore deeper, use the newly added **nautilus**
submarine crafted with different materials for under sea exporation.

## Farming tools
