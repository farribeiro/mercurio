# tools_obsidian
Minetest Obsidian Tools mod.
Adds the obsidian sword, dagger and longsword.  
Also adds the obsidian axe, pickaxe, and shovel, for completeness.  

Each weapon has its uses, advantages, and tradeoffs.  

Obsidian Sword: Slightly stronger than a regular diamond sword, at the expense of being slightly slower.  
Obsidian Dagger: Quick and durable, with a shorter range and low per-hit damage.  
Obsidian Longsword: Very powerful with a long reach, slow but strong swings.
