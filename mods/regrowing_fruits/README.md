Regrowing Fruits
===

Info
----

This mod causes fruits on trees from various other mods to regrow like apples in the 5.0 release of Minetest Game. If you placed the fruits by hand or removed the tree leaves, the fruits don't regrow.

Cool_trees modpack, ethereal, farming_plus, multibiomegen, australia, aotearoa and moretrees are supported, but maybe there are other mods with this problem that I don't know about. Please tell me in the Minetest Forum topic!

Default apples in older versions than Minetest 5.0 will also regrow.
